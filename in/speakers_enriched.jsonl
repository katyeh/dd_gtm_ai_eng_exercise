This role involves the delivery of product information for Tata Steel’s UK businesses as well as the digital reach and interlock of the business through its data and platforms. Although starting with product-specific data, Alex’s role looks at ways in which a wide-ranging array of data might be linked to physical products (through Tag & Track, Digital Product Passports and Digital Twins) to add value for product traceability, circular economy and digital integration as a whole. Alex sits on several working groups, including the CLC’s NGD Industrialised Construction Workstream and GS1’s UK Construction group. He also sits on various International, European and British digital construction standards committees. He is an active member of Constructing Excellence – chairing their manufacturing, technology and offsite theme group – and sits on Construction Product Europe’s Digital Task Group. Recently, Alex headed up Tata Steel’s involvement with the SEISMIC project – a construction platform predominantly geared towards modular manufacturers and founded the Manufacturers’ Information Hub – a single access point for all European construction product manufacturers’ product information. Alex is a keen advocate for structured data, IoT, AI, DfMA, offsite construction and an integrated, digital, built environment.", "talk_titles": ["The Manufacturers Information Hub: Live information management workshop", "The Manufacturers Information Hub: UK registration launch"], "session_descriptions": ["Following the launch of UK Registration for the Manufacturers’ Information Hub (MIH), founding members of the Hub will lead an interactive workshop at the Information Management Exchange.

Supporters of the MIH include 18 of the largest construction manufacturers across Europe, five national construction product associations, and many major contractors and developers, distributors and European government departments. In this official launch event the hub founders will introduce the concept and explain: • What the Manufacturers’ Information Hub aims to achieve • How the MIH fits within the building safety regulatory framework • How manufacturers can get a stake in the project and get involved in shaping it The presentation will be followed by a panel session with audience invited questions.
